# CS 1555 Project

This is the repository for our CS 1555 Database Management Systems project.

## Purpose

"The primary goal of this project is to implement a single Java application program that will back a new social networking system called FaceSpace." It will include "the basic information found in a social networking system such as user profiles, friends, groups, messages, etc."

## Collaborators

- **Benjamin Lind**
- **Autumn Good**
- **Fadi Alchoufete**

## Concurrency

This program assumes that only one person will access the database at a time. There are not protections in place to ensure concurrent access works correctly.
